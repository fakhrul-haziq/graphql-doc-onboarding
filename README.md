# Auto-generated omni-onboarding-be GraphQL API

This repository contains an auto-generated GraphQL API using MagiDoc. MagiDoc is a tool that allows for easy generation and previewing of GraphQL APIs.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js version 18

## Getting Started

To get started with the MagiDoc auto-generated GraphQL API, follow the instructions below:

### 1. Installation

```bash
npm install --global @magidoc/cli@latest
```

### 2. Build the documentation

```bash
magidoc generate
```

### 3. Preview the documentation

After building the API, you can preview it using the following command:

```bash
magidoc preview
```

This will start a local server where you can interact with the generated GraphQL API.

## Additional Information

For more advanced configurations and usage of MagiDoc, refer to the [MagiDoc documentation](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc).

## Disclaimer

The GraphQL schema remains fixed and will not be modified automatically according to the omni-onboarding-backoffice. Any changes to the schema must be updated manually if necessary.
